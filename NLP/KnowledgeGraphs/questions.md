- What KBs do we use ? (what is the data on which auto KB creation is run) (assuming we're not using autocorrelation measure as a feature)

- Make model search KB (i.e. model generates SQL-like queries but for a KB)

- Data Cleaning: How to know that their data is the wrong one not ours.

- We will eventually run into contradicting sentences, how do you deal with that ?

- Augmenting ??

- Cleaning (is it a manual (human depenedent) process ?)

# Ch2

- Named entities: are they absolute ? maybe an entity is unidentifiable given my current data, and how would I know if it were unique or not.
  
  A: depends on data

- Doesn't the process seem too much of a rule based process? is the automatic creation discussed later  on?.

- How do you automatically capture types ?
  - Unless explicitly stated (Eminem is a songwriter)
  - But even then how would you create the taxonomy ?

  A: Addressed in ch4

# Ch3

- Drifting super categories

# Ch5

- in Entity linking, when you map a mention to null (out of kb), this means that you didn't actually create new entities in the KB.


# Ch6

- How do you assume that you have target properties (i.e. know that for class x, you're looking for prop 1, prop 2 ...etcc)
  - I get that for some it's obvious but surely that doesn't apply to all classes
