## <u>Question answering</u>

- We often need **answers** to our questions instead of just search results, especially on **mobile** or **digital assistant** like Alexa, Google Assistant ....
- We can divide **question answering** into two parts:
  1. Finding documents that **(might)** contain an answer
     - Handled by **traditional information retrieval / web search**
     - We use traditional methods because they are **highly scalable** as there are a lot of information on the web
  2. Finding an answer in a paragraph or a document
     - This problem is often termed **Reading Comprehension** and will be the focus of today's lecture
