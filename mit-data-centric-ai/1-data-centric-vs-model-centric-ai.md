# Data Centric AI vs Model Centric AI

## What is not data-centric AI?

1. Hand-picking a bunch of data points you think will improve a model
2. Double the size of your dataset and train an improved model on more data

## Data-centric AI versions

1. Coreset selection
   - If 1B example gives 98% accuracy, can we pick 1M examples to give 97%? 
2. Dataset Augmentation

****

## Examples of Data-Centric AI

- Outlier detection and removal (handling abnormal examples in ds)
- Error detection and correction (handling incorrect values/labels)
- Data Augmentation
- Feature Engineering and Selection
- Establishing Consensus Labels (determining true label from crowdsourced annotations)
- Active Learning (selection the most informative data to label next)
- Curriculum learning (ordering examples in dataset from easiest to hardest)
