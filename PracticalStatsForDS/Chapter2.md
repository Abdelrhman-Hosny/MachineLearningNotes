### <u>**Student's t-Distribution**</u>

the t-distribution is a <u>*normally shaped distribution*</u>, but a bit *thicker and longer on the tails*. It is used extensively in depicting distributions of sample statistics.

Distributions of sample means are typically shaped like a t-distribution , and there is a family of t-distributions that differ depending on **how large the sample is**. The *larger* the sample  , The *more* normally shaped the t-distribution becomes.

| **Degrees of freedom** | A parameter that allows the t-distribution to adjust to different sample sizes , statistics and number of groups |

Degrees of freedom = n - 1 where n is the sample size.

#### <u>When to use student-t distribution?</u>

You should use a normal distribution if you:

-  Have a big enough sample size (n >= 500).
- Have the population value of standard deviation.

Used when you want to establish a confidence interval for a sample with low sample size.

The higher the degree of freedom , the more closely it resembles a normal distribution. until v = $\infin$ then t-distribution is the same as normal distribution.

### **<u>Weibull Distribution</u>**

It is similar to the exponential distribution ,however the event rate changes over time.

This is used to model time until failure especially in mechanical components as the more time passes the more likely that a part will fail.
